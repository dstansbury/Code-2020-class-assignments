1.) we created a programme to filter a large data set down to a smaller one, looking for large expenditures on water.
2.) we ran the programme using data obtained from a website.
3.) we took the output from our programme and put it into a new file, in CSV format.
4.) we inspected the different parts of the file for important info using csvstat
5.) inspecting the csv data in an excel file we can see that some members expensed over $1000 on water in a single year.
